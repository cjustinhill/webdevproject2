                        <p>Emmanuel Santiago was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico. His father was a producer for Sony Music and often worked with the famous salsa artists of the time, Anuel's father was eventually laid off by Sony which placed the family into a state of poverty.</p>
                        <p>The family moved to a more humble area of Carolina, and Anuel was exposed to the the violent street life so prevalent in the sector. However, Anuel never lost his passion for music. This gift that he inherited from his father was something that Anuel would develop in his adolescence.</p>
                        <p>After releasing a few singles and featuring on the singles of other popular artists, Anuel become a phenomenon in Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>He was quickly known all over the island and in the latin music community in general for his take on trap music. What was then a genre dominated by english speaking rappers from Atlanta was done extremely tastefully by Anuel to recount stories from the streets of Carolina.</p>
                        <p>Although the gang-related themes of Anuels music were very relatable and tasteful for many listeners, they came with a price.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Imprisonment</h2>
                        <p>In 2017, Anuel was arrested and convicted on illegal weapons charges and sentenced to 30 months in Federal Prison. The sentence was harsh and most thought it was more than enough to crush his young career.</p>
                        <p>Luckily, Anuel had recorded enough music prior to his sentence, that his management team was able to release a new song almost every month during his sentence, along with a few songs recorded through a prison phone.</p>
                        <p>These songs were enough to light a #FreeAnuel movement across social media, other latin music stars showed support for Anuel and what seemed like the end of his career was avoided.</p>
                        <p>Anuel entered the federal prison with 400k followers on instagram, thanks to the foreplanning of his team and the #FreeAnuel movement he left prison with over 4 million instagram followers.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Back On Top</h2>
                        <p>After leaving prison, Anuel was a hot commodity in the music industry. He was invited to do features with most of the genres top artists and quickly rose to the top of the charts, joining artists that had spent no time away from music.</p>
