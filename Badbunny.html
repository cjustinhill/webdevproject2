                        <p>Benito Martinez, AKA Bad Bunny, was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He grew up in a nearby small town called Vega Baja. He was an overall pretty average kid; he stayed out of trouble, went to church with his grandmother, and liked to spend time at home with his family.</p>
                        <p>He discovered a passion for music when he was 13 and began making his own interpolations of already popular songs. He began publishing his music on the platform Soundcloud..</p>
                        <p>As a teenager, Benito worked at a grocery store, bagging groceries at the check out lanes, but still had aspirations to succeed in music.</p>
                        <p>Eventually one of his Soundcloud songs was discovered by DJ Luian, who signed Benito to his record label.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Fame</h2>
                        <p>Bad Bunny immediately took over. He started making trap songs which were now popular in Puerto Rico because of Anuel. This helped him get a name in the industry and eventually help him define his own sound.</p>
                        <p>Almost out of nowhere, Bad Bunny began collaborating with some of the world's biggest artists. He released multiple singles with J. Balvin, and a single with American Rapper Drake.</p>
                        <p>By the time Bad Bunny released his first studio album, he had already accomplished what few artists could hope to do.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Dominance</h2>
                        <p>Since his single with Drake in 2018, Bad Bunny has released 5 studio albums and a mixtape that have dominated the world. His songs from years past are still on the Billboard Hot100, and his most recent work fills up most of the list.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Bad Bunny performing in Yankee Stadium in 2022.</span>
                        <p>This past year, Bad Bunny became the first artist to win the title of most-listened artist 3 years in a row, and was also named Apple Music artist of the year.</p>
                        <p>It seems that no matter what Bad Bunny seems to touch goes multi-platinum, and although the artist has said he will use 2023 to "rest," fans still expect a lot in the years to come from such a young artist.</p>
