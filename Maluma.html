                        <p>Maluma was born in Medellin, Colombia as Juan Luis Londo√±o. As a kid, Juan was a talented soccer player, andd was able to compete for the youth division teams for two of Medellins professional club teams.</p>
                        <p>However, Juan was also a talented singer and found more passion and enjoyment in music. When he turned 15, his uncle paid for studio time as a gift, so that Juan could record his own song.</p>
                        <p>His talent was quickly noted by studio executives and he was soon signed to a record deal, when asked what his stage name would be he chose "Maluma" combining the first two letters of his parents and sisters names.</p>
                        <p>By the age of 21, Maluma had released 3 studio albums and became famous in Colombia, and in the latin community in general.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Pride of Colombia</h2>
                        <p>Although Maluma is known for having a very pop-like persona and style, he has done very well in representing his culture. He has kept his thick Colombian accent at the expense of criticism from the Puerto-Rican dominated market.</p>
                        <p>He has always incorporated parts of Colombia's culture into latin pop, reggaeton, and he has even done a salsa song with Marc Anthony. No matter where he has gone, he has not forgotten his roots.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Worldwide Sensation</h2>
                        <p>As is the case for many latin artists, Maluma has seen an explosion of popularity during the last few years. He began ad campaigns for popular designer brands in Europe, voiced a character in the Pixar film Encanto, and acted in a movie alongside Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson.</p>

                        <p>Now, with colloborations with English-speaking artists such as the Weeknd, Adam Levine, and many others, Maluma is quickly becoming a household name around the world. One of his most recent accomplishments was the honor of performing the song of the 2022 World Cup. </p>
